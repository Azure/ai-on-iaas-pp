# Architecture Deepdives
This section is a collection of real-world end-to-end architectures for AI solutions that are in production on Azure. This collection is indented to provide examples on how you may want to deploy your AI solution in a production ready setting. 

Each end-to-end architecture will also link back to relevant parts of the tutorial section so that you can deploy the same thing.

## Demand Forecasting with Spark
This case-study is an end-to-end IoT scenario that uses Spark on AZTK for processing, training and scoring signal data. 

## Real-time Predictive Maintenance with Deep Learning
This case-study illustrates how AKS can be used for scoring CNN models in real-time in a large scale predictive maintenance scenario.
