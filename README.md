# AI on IaaS++ Toolkit

The AI on IaaS++ toolkit is a set of scripts, guidelines, and architectural recommendations to help data scientists and data engineers work effectively and deploy production code on Azure's AI IaaS++ stack.

## What is Azure's AI IaaS++ Stack?
Today in Azure, there are a myriad of tools and services that were designed for AI workloads. However, for a data scientist new to Azure, there are several entry points where on can start to develop and eventually deploy their AI solutions. 

| Tier         | Name   | Services                                       |
|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Highest Tier | PaaS   | Databricks, AML                                |
| **Middle Tier**  | **IaaS++** | **DSVM/DLVM, AZTK, BatchAI, AKS, Azure Functions** |
| Lowest Tier  | IaaS   | Compute, Network, Storage                      |

This toolkit focuses on the middle tier illustrated in the table above.
