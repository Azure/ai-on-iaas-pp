### Deploy your Spark model to AZTK for batch processing/training/scoring
AZTK allows you to deploy, manage and run Apache Spark clusters in a simple and cost-efficient way.

1. Deploy a CPU or GPU enabled AZTK Spark cluster from your local machine
2. Setting up your AZTK Spark cluster to read/write data from Azure Blob
3. Use AZTK's interactive-mode to run jupyter notebooks and the Spark UI
4. Use Azure Functions to automate your AZTK batch job 

Please see this architecture [link] reference for a full end-to-end batch scoring sceanrio with Spark on AZTK.

### Deploy your DL model to BatchAI for batch scoring
BatchAI allows you to deploy, manage and run compute intensive deep learning jobs in a cost-efficient way.

1. Deploy a CPU or GPU enabled BatchAI cluster from your local machine
2. Mount a fileshare to your BatchAI cluster
3. Set up Tensorboard on BatchAI for monitoring your run history
3. Use Azure Functions to automate your DL jobs 

Please see this architecture [link] reference for a full end-to-end batch scoring sceanrio with Tensorflow on BatchAI.
